# Hi there, I'm Rau 👋

🧑🏻‍💻 I'm a self-taught **Frontend Developer**  with a strong focus on UI. I've worked on a wide range of projects, from small landing pages to large web applications, and have developed a mobile-first approach to ensure the best possible user experience across all devices.

📚 I'm currently learning Next.js and working on some Frontend Mentor and CodePen projects while waiting for a new challenge!

👀 You can see my work on [Frontend Mentor]() and [CodePen](). Let's connect!
